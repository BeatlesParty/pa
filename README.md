Tank World Online Beta1.0

The first version of my online game website

What I did best in the projec is how I planned to make some alternations to my page, including a movie playing part on my homepage and some alternations in colors.
As for the movie playing system, I searched online for the solutions while I did some research on the colors as well. For the review filling system, I spent a lot of time alternating and debugging. Turns out, the problem is with the calling mechanisms that I made the wrong name call while sending back the data to the data processing page.
